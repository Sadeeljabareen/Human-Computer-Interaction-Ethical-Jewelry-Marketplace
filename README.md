This project presents a mobile-first Ethical Jewellery Marketplace designed through Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles, focusing on usability, emotional engagement, and transparency. 
The app connects users with ethically sourced, handcrafted jewelry by showcasing artisan stories, production traceability, and environmental responsibility. 
Key features include an interactive “Trace My Jewelry” journey that reveals each piece’s sourcing and creation process, a “Meet the Maker” section with live or recorded artisan videos to build human connection, and an AR-based virtual try-on experience that enhances decision-making and trust. 
Users can also customize their own jewelry by choosing metals, gemstones, and engravings, all supported by a step-by-step guided interface. A built-in rewards system encourages sustainable purchases through redeemable points. 
The design process followed the Double Diamond Model, supported by extensive user research, including surveys, interviews, and focus groups across diverse demographics. 
Based on this feedback, we prioritized clear visual design, accessible navigation (flat menus), and features that balance emotional value with ease of use. 
Prototypes were iteratively developed from low to high fidelity using Figma, tested with users, and improved accordingly. 
The platform reflects core HCI goals like usability, efficiency, appeal, and user trust, offering a purposeful, transparent, and empowering shopping experience rooted in ethical values.
